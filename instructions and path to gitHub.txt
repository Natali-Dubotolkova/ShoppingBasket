Instructions for how to compile and run my application:

1. You need the .NET Core SDK installed for your platform. 
2. Then, you can go in command line into your project directory (the folder that contains your .csproj file) and run: dotnet build
3. You can see a green message about "Build succeeded", warnings, errors, and time. Also you can see the path to dll (in my case: path to "CountBasket.dll")
4. Go to this path and run dotnet CountBasket.dll
